## Overview

There are five Jupyter notebooks, each exploring a different question about Jalen Brunson's 2024-2025 regular season performance. Each notebook features:
- data cleaning
- exploratory data analysis 
- visualizations
- key takeaways and findings based on metrics

### Notebooks

#### Chaya_eda.ipynb 

Is there a relationship between Brunson‚Äôs play time (rounded down to minutes) and the Knicks winning?

#### Chidi_eda.ipynb 

How have Brunson‚Äôs scoring trends evolved throughout the 2024-2025 regular season?
 Answer: For the 2024-25 NBA season, my visualization shows that Jalen Brunson's points scored remained consistent throughout the season, with an average of 26 points per game, with the highest points made in a game being 44 points total. The visualization does show a sharp decrease in points made, which coincides with an injury Jalen sustained in March, which made him sit out for a while in order to heal. I can infer from the data that due to the average points made per game, Jalen maintains a consistent level of performance and effort, which shows he is a player that can be relied upon to deliver for his team.
